## Angular Getting Started - Web mail client  

### Step 0 - Baseline

1. Download / Install Node.js :  
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    
   This will give you both node and npm

2. Install Angular-CLI

   `$ npm install -g @angular/cli`
   
   verify:
   ```
   $ ng --version
       _                      _                 ____ _     ___
      / \   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|
     / â–³ \ | '_ \ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |
    / ___ \| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |
   /_/   \_\_| |_|\__, |\__,_|_|\__,_|_|       \____|_____|___|
                  |___/
   @angular/cli: 1.4.9
   node: 6.11.4
   os: darwin x64

   ```
   === Success!!
   
### Step 1 - Initialize new project with Angular-CLI

1. Initialize project
    
   `$ ng new angular-mail --style=scss`
   
   Creates project directory, initializes git project, with common project defaults, including:
   - src directory with a single page, app module and app component
   - unit test configuration with jasmine and karma
   - e2e test configuration with protractor
   - configuration files for typescript
   - installs all required libraries
   
2. Verify project

   `$ ng serve --open`
   
   Starts the development server and opens a browser on the index page
   
3. Run some unit tests
  
   `$ ng test`
   
   Watches for file changes and re-runs tests

### Step 2 - Mailbox Infrastructure

1. Add Global Styles
    
    Resets + commonly used clases
    
2. Create mail-message class. 
   
   `$ ng generate class mail-message`
   
   Add properties to class: id (default to null), subject, sender, recipient, dateSent, body. 
   
3. Create mail.service
   
   `$ ng genreate service mail`
   
   Add methods to get inbox and outbox messages, and handle errors

### Step 3 - Mailbox Component

1. Add Routes

    Used to navigate through different parts of the system. 
    
    Always start with routes as a way of getting an early understanding of how components are composed and interact with each other    

    Without components angular router complains

2. Add mailbox component

   `$ ng generate component mailbox`
       
   Smart components responsible for gathering data and event handling (wiring)
       
   Typically don't have much styling, because they are not presenting anything
  
   Don't forget to namespace your components!

3. Add mailbox-list component

   `$ ng generate component mailbox-list`
    
   Dumb components are responsible for presenting data - update container to pass observables to children
    
   Typically handle the styles, take data as input and dispatch events up to the container

   Don't forget to declare the new component in the unit test for the container!

4. Get some data in your routes

   You can have your components fetch data directly, however resolves ensure that data is available before route changes.

5. Add mailbox controls component
  
    `$ ng generate component mailbox-controls`
    
    Simple series of links to navigate between mailboxes
    
    Again, this needs to be declared in the mailbox component spec to prevent failures

### Step 4 - Message Reader Component

1. Add message-reader component

   `$ ng generate component message-reader`
   
   Smart component for reading messages

   Update routes and mailbox template to include child routing

2. Add message-detail component

   `$ ng generate component message-detail`

   Dumb component for displaying a message

3. View messages from server
  
   Add service methods for viewing messages
   
   Add resolvers, update routes

### Step 5 - Delete Message

1. Add service method to handle deletes, hide message on delete

   Smart component handles data interaction, response

   "But wait, I can still see the message in the mailbox!!?"
   
2. Add an in memory object to manage mailbox state
   
   `$ ng generate service mailbox`

   Message component populates mailbox, Message Reader removes successfully deleted messages

### Step 6 - Message Composer

1. Create message-composer component

   `$ ng generate component message-composer`

   Smart component, handles send and cancel
   
2. Update Routes

   Use message-composer for 'compose' routes
